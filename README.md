# Morpheus Model Management
Morpheus Model Management is a ComfyUI custom node designed to provide controlled, authenticated access to AI-generated talent datasets, combined with a structured metadata layer for identity consistency across advanced generation pipelines.

The node does not act as a static model repository.
Instead, it functions as a gateway and orchestration layer between ComfyUI workflows and a remote, access-controlled talent archive.
